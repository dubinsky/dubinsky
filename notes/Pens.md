  - Pilot Prera – good fro writing, slower ink flow, very exact, with this converter
  - Sailor HighAce – a little long and thin. writes very well.
  - Pilot 78G – Medium Nib – nice flex, good for drawing. Same pen with fine nib – great for writing and small sketches. hisnibs.com is, however, retarded website, have to order via email. 
  - Pilot Custom 74 at richardspens.com – (you can tell him how to adjust your pen, he is a nib master) perfect for drawing, very nice flow.
