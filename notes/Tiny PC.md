title: Tiny PC
---
- After much thought, I decided that I want Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny Gen 2 instead of a NUC 11. It is similar to HP and Dell 1L PCs, but I'll stick with Lenovo I think. I want:
  - maybe i7-11700 (without the T) processor
  - maybe even i9
  - maybe additional USB-C port (although looks like it's Gen 1)
  - maybe the smallest RAM/SDD and no keyboars/mouse - I supply my own...
  - maybe stand
  - maybe filter
- but the thing is not yet configurable...
