# Diversification

I need to avoid “tax efficient” funds, since what they are trying to avoid does not apply to me.

[QQQI](https://neosfunds.com/qqqi/) is not a good idea, not because it uses call options, and not because of tax repercussions which do not apply to me, and not because of its 0.86% fee, but because it is too concentrated and thus not “safe”.

I need examples of high-quality funds in each category…

My allocation (work in progress):
- 18 months of money in safe liquid instruments (money markets)
	- do I need to allocate a part of my bonds bucket to Certificates of Deposit or just increase the cash amount?
- Corporate Bonds 20%
	- some portion - high-yield (junk bonds)
	- Question: what portion should be junk bonds?
	- Question: how is this better than a bond index fund that combines treasury and investment grade corporate funds?
- Stocks 80%
	- 3/8 US grows stock fund
	- 4/8 income (dividend) stock fund
	- Question: why is this better than a whole-market US stock index fund?
	- 1/8 international growth stock fund

Malkiel asset classes:
- Cash
	- money-market fund or short-term bond fund (average maturity 1 to 1.5 years)
- Stocks
	- 1/2 US stocks with good representation of smaller growth companies
	- 1/2 international stocks, including emerging markets
- Bonds and bond substitutes:
	- no-load high-grade corporate bond fund
	- some Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS)
	- foreign bonds
	- dividend growth stocks
- Real Estate:
	- portfolio of REITs

Malkiel allocation:

| age                            | cash | bonds | stocks | real  |
| ------------------------------ | ---- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| mid-twenties                   | 5%   | 15%   | 70%    | 10%   |
| late thirties to early forties | 5%   | 20%   | 65%    | 10%   |
| mid-fifties                    | 5%   | 27.5% | 55%    | 12.5% |
| late sixties and beyond        | 10%  | 55%   | 40%    | 15%   |
