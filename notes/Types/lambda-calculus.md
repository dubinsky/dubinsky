## Untyped lambda-calculus ##

Assuming infinite (countable) set Variable of variables (x, y, ...),
Term (t, u, ...) is:
- Variable           or
- λ Variable . Term  (_abstraction_) or
- Term Term          (_application_)

Conventions:
  - application associates to the left: tuv means (tu)v;
  - application binds stronger than the abstraction: λx.xy means λx.(xy);
  - abstractions can be grouped: λxyz.xz(yz) means λx.λy.λz.xz(yz).

Variable x in λx.t is _bound_; variable than is not bound is _free_;
term with no free variables is _closed_.

_χ-reduction_ is the least binary relation on terms
such that when t →<sub>χ</sub> t' then also:
- λx.t →<sub>χ</sub> λx.t' (ξ-reduction);
- tu →<sub>χ</sub> t'u (congruence);
- ut →<sub>χ</sub> ut' (congruence)

and:
- α-reduction: λx.t →<sub>α</sub> λy.t', where t' is t with all free occurrences of x
renamed to y;
- β-reduction: (λx.t)u →<sub>β</sub> t', where t' is t with all free occurrences of x
replaced by u (_substitution_, t[u/x]);
- η-reduction (extensionality): λx.t →<sub>η</sub> t.

if t →<sub>χ</sub> u, t is a χ-redex; _χ-expansion_ is a relation opposite to →<sub>χ</sub>;
↠<sub>χ</sub> (multi-step reduction; reduction path) is the reflexive and transitive
closure of →<sub>χ</sub>; ＝<sub>χ</sub> (χ-equivalence, χ-convertability) is the symmetric closure
of ↠<sub>χ</sub>.

Term that can not be reduced is in _normal form_ (a _value_). Term t is _weekly
normalizing_ if there exist a normal form u such that t ↠<sub>β</sub> u. Term is
_strongly normalizing_ when every sequence of reductions will eventually produce a
normal form. Not all terms a strongly normalizing (for example, Ω = (λx.xx)(λx.xx)
reduces to itself), but (_confluence_, _Church-Rosser property_):
if t ↠<sub>β</sub> u<sub>1</sub> and t ↠<sub>β</sub> u<sub>2</sub>,
there exists such v that: u<sub>1</sub> ↠<sub>β</sub> v and u<sub>2</sub> ↠<sub>β</sub> v.

When substituting a term for a bound variable, care needs to be taken not to
accidentally "capture" a variable that is free in that term. This is a great pain
for the implementers (who can't just say that terms are equivalence classes
by ＝<sub>α</sub>), and various tricks were developed to ease it (de-Brujin
indices, Barendregt convention); we will say no more about it, and just assume
that before substitution all variables that need to be distinct are given fresh names :)

### Encodings ###

We can (and eventually will) _extend_ the calculus by adding new term forms together
with the corresponding reduction rules. For example, for products,
we can add three forms of terms -
〈t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>〉, π<sub>1</sub> and π<sub>2</sub> and two
β-reduction rules - π<sub>i</sub>〈t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>〉→<sub>β</sub> t<sub>i</sub>.

It is also possible to just _encode_ common types and data structures in the untyped lambda calculus:
- identity: I = λx.x
- booleans: T = λxy.x; F = λxy.y
- if-then-else: if = λbxy.bxy (if T t u ↠<sub>β</sub> t; if F t u ↠<sub>β</sub> u)
- logical operations: and = λxy.xyF; or = λxy.xTy; nor = λx.xFT;
- product and projections: pair = λxyb. if b x y; π<sub>1</sub> = λp.pT; π<sub>2</sub> = λp.pF
(π<sub>i</sub>(pair t<sub>1</sub> t<sub>2</sub>) ↠<sub>β</sub> t<sub>i</sub>)
- Church numerals: **n** = λfx.f(f(...(fx))) where f is applied n times; **0** = λnfx.x
- succ = λnfx.f(nfx)
- add = λmnfx.m succ n; mul = λmnfx.m (add n) 0; exp = λmn.n (mul m) 1
- iszero = λnxy.n(λz.y)x
- pred = λnfx.n(λgh.h(gf))(λy.x)(λy.y)
- sub = λmn.n pred m
- leq = λmn.iszero (sub m n)

### Fixed points ###

u is a _fixed point_ of term u if t u ↠<sub>β</sub> u; in lambda-calculus,
**every** term has a fixed point, **and** there is a term Y (_fixed point combinator_)
such that Yt is a fixed point of t! For example:
- _Curry fixed point combinator_: Y = λf.(λx.f(xx))(λx.f(xx))
- _Turing fixed point combinator_: ϴ = (λfx.x(ffx))(λfx.x(ffx))

(Fixed point combinator is the Russel paradox in disguise when terms are read as
predicates, λx.t is read as {x | t}, and tu is read as u ∈ t.)

Functions definable in lambda-calculus are precisely the recursive ones 
(_Kleene theorem_).

### Reduction strategies ###

Orders on redexes:
 - all the redexes of t and u are _inside_ the redex (λx.t)u;
 - all the redexes of t are to the _left_ of all the redexes of u in tu.

Reduction strategy determines the order in which the redexes in a term get reduced:
- _innermost_ (=call by value) (_outermost_ (=call by name)) strategy selects the most _inside_ (_outside_) redexes;
- _left_ (_right_) strategy selects the the most _left_ (_right_) redexes.
- _week_ strategy never reduces abstractions λx.t, even if there are redexes in t;
- left strategy is _head_ if it never reduces variable applications x t1 ... tn even
  if some ti has redexes.
- _normal order_ strategy is leftmost outermost; it is normalizing: if the term has
  a normal form, this strategy will find it (_standardization theorem_).

### Combinatory logic ###

All λ-terms can be built (up to β-equivalence) from just three _combinators_, thus avoiding
variables, α-conversion and all that, and formulating β-reduction directly on the combinators:
- I = λx.x (using a variable);
- S = λxyz.(xz)(yz) (duplicating a variable);
- K = λxy.x (erasing a variable).

Actually, just S and K suffice as the "basis" of the λ-calculus, since I = S K K.

Indeed, _one_ combinator is sufficient: ι = λx.xSK; we can then define:
I = ιι; K = ι(ι(ιι)); S = ι(ι(ι(ιι))). So, every λ-term can be encoded as a binary word ;)

Besides being cute, nameless (combinator-based) representations of λ-terms are
used in implementation of functional programming languages. But people normally do not program in it.

### Models ###

Setting aside combinatory algebra models, classic model of the untyped
lambda calculus uses [domains](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/domain+theory),
where the conundrum of D≅D⇒D resulting from the fact that in untyped lambda calculus
everything is a function and anything can be applied to anything gets resolved by
considering _monotone_/_continuous_ functions.

### Problems ###

Encoding everything is not an approach suitable for human programmers.

Some properties of the untyped lambda-calculus contradict intuitions about functions:
- everything can be applied to everything (including itself);
- everything has a fixed point;
- a term is not guaranteed to have a normal form (some calculations get stuck).

The main problem is that since there is only one type, and propositions **are** types,
it is impossible to express any properties of the functions being defined.
We need to introduce types - starting with the simple ones.
