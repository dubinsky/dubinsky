## Tonal

During the second week of January, 2026 I looked into home gym setups, focused on machines with "digital weights" where resistance is controlled by the motor, allowing for features like auto-spotter, "chains", "drop sets" etc., then zeroed in on [Tonal](https://tonal.com/) over its competition (Titan, OxeFit, AEKE, Speediance). On January 12th, we scheduled a demo at a newly opened local Tonal [showroom]( https://tonal.com/pages/store/natick) - and ordered the machine ;)

When I subscribed to Tonal's emails, I got a code that makes accessory bundle (handles, bar, rope, roller, mat, bench) free; sometimes it is the extended warranty that the deal is on...

I ordered additional accessories that are not a part of the bundle: ankle straps and Pilates loops.

- Tonal: $4,295
- Accessories Bundle: $495 (free with code)
- Delivery and Installation: $295
- Extended Warranty: 4 years $424; 5 years $449 - I paid for 5 years
- [Ankle Straps](https://tonal.com/collections/accessories/products/tonal-ankle-straps?variant=51036311388442) $40
- [Pilates Loops](https://tonal.com/collections/accessories/products/pilates-loops?variant=51163687321882) $100

The total: $5,179 plus $277.19 in taxes.

Subscription that is needed for the normal functioning of the machine is $59.95/month.

The thing got installed on 2026/5/2; we tried it out and quit KoKo ;)

### Shelf

Tonal-branded [shelf](https://tonal.com/collections/accessories/products/tonal-accessories-shelf), in addition to being expensive ($220), turned out to be badly designed and can only hold four accessories, which is enough for the standard bundle (two handles, rope and bar), but not enough for the additional accessories (ankle straps, Pilates loops).

A $60 after-market alternative ([1](https://www.amazon.com/Crostice-Floating-Compatible-Accessories-Organizer/dp/B0C4DTXKVV), [2](https://www.amazon.com/Crostice-Compatible-Accessories-Floating-Organizer/dp/B0D49V9SXW)) is not sturdy enough according to some reviews; another $40 [alternative](https://www.amazon.com/Novabright-Compatible-Accessories-T-bracket-Equipment/dp/B0G4M2Q6YS) is not wide enough to mount on the wall studs.

On 2026/02/12, we ordered an USA-made small-shop $60 [product](https://bennettbuiltdesigns.com/collections/tonal/products/tonal%E2%84%A2-accessories-wall-shelf).
