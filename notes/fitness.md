## Tonal

During the second week of January, 2026 I looked into home gym setups, focused on machines with "digital weights" where resistance is controlled by the motor, allowing for features like auto-spotter, "chains", "drop sets" etc., then zeroed in on [Tonal](https://tonal.com/) over its competition (Titan, OxeFit, AEKE, Speediance). On January 12th, we scheduled a demo at a newly opened local Tonal [showroom]( https://tonal.com/pages/store/natick) - and ordered the machine ;)

When it arrives and is installed, if we like it, we are going to quit KoKo ;)

When I subscribed to Tonal's emails, I got a code that makes accessory bundle (handles, bar, rope, roller, mat, bench) free; sometimes it is the extended warranty that the deal is on...

I ordered additional accessories that are not a part of the bundle: ankle straps and Pilates loops.

- Tonal: $4,295
- Accessories Bundle: $495 (free with code)
- Delivery and Installation: $295
- Extended Warranty: 4 years $424; 5 years $449 - I paid for 5 years
- [Ankle Straps](https://tonal.com/collections/accessories/products/tonal-ankle-straps?variant=51036311388442) $40
- [Pilates Loops](https://tonal.com/collections/accessories/products/pilates-loops?variant=51163687321882) $100

The total: $5,179 plus $277.19 in taxes.

Subscription that is needed for the normal functioning of the machine is $59.95/month.
