title: Range Bag

Tried backpack with 2-gun plastic case in it and a 4-5 guns plastic case with accessories in a separate bag; decided that the way to go is small range bag with two guns in rugs in lockable side pockets, and if more is needed - in lockable pouches in the main compartment. Headphones, glasses, cartridges, loader etc. should fit there too.
