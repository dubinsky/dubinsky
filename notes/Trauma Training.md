## TECC

According to "Prepping for Life" by Grant Cunningham (2017), Red Cross is not place; Tactical Emergency Casualty Care (TECC) course is the thing.

[C-TECC](https://www.c-tecc.org/), Committee for Tactical Emergency Casualty Care, produces TECC [Guidelines](https://www.c-tecc.org/our-work/guidance).

[NAEMT](https://www.naemt.org/), National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians, created the [courses](https://www.naemt.org/education/trauma-education/tecc/tecc-courses); what, when and where is available can be searched at [CourseDirectory](https://naemt.org/education/CourseDirectory).

Courses that are not about trauma are:
- AMLS - Advanced Medical Life Support
- EPC - Emergency Pediatric Care

Courses that are about trauma are:
- TECC
- PHTLS - Prehospital Trauma Life Support

So far, the only "Open for Public" courses I found are TECC, run for the Cape Cod CPR by Matthew Regan. Maybe contact him directly for advice?

## Stop the Bleed

There is also [Stop the Bleed](https://www.stopthebleed.org/training/), whose 2-hour course is easier to find: [Class Search](https://cms.bleedingcontrol.org/Class/Search).

In our area, pre-eminent provider is [Emergency Response Training](https://www.emergencyresponsetraining.com/bleed.php) of Woburn, with Joseph Boykin as the instructor. Course description:
>Life threatening bleeding can occur from car accidents, kitchen accidents, dog bites, man made, and natural disasters. Bleeding is the #1 cause of _preventable_ death!

>We provide an _expanded_ version of the official “Stop The Bleed” program to train the general public (lay rescuers) and emergency responders how to recognize and control life-threatening bleeding.

>The course is four hours long and includes both a formal presentation and hands-on practice of bandaging techniques, extrication techniques, application of direct pressure, wound packing, and use of a tourniquet.

>In addition to wound packing and tourniquets we also practice proper safety such as glove removal, basic bandaging, and extrication techniques. We also talk about equipment and products that you should consider.

>Students may optionally receive formal certification (Advanced Bleeding Control) through the American Safety & Health Institute (ASHI), part of the Health & Safety Institute (HSI), for taking this program.

>Pricing: $49.00/pp. Classes are scheduled regularly at our Woburn training center or private classes can be arranged. Classes of six or more taught at your site!
