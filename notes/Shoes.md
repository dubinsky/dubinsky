Greg at [Colonial Shoe Repair](https://colonialshoerepair.com/) seems to be a good cobbler.

I have Finn Comfort
- Baltrum sandals: 41
- Milano: 8 UK
- Budapest: 8 UK

Let's try some better Oxford/Blucher/Gibbons lace-ups
that are compatible with orthotics, i.e. have removable footbeds.

Shell cordovan looks interesting, but there are downsides that probably make it
[not for me](https://shoegazing.com/2020/06/05/in-depth-the-downside-of-shell-cordovan/) (too stiff and does not breathe).

Material:
- calfskin
- Regina calf?
not:
- waxhide
- shell
- full grain

Styles:
- plain toe
- straight cap
- medallion cap
not:
- long wing tip
- Balmoral saddle
- Algonquin Split Toe

- [Grant Stone](http://www.grantstoneshoes.com)
- Johnson & Murphy - quality deteriorated

Questions:
- which lasts have removable footbeds ([Ortho](http://www.aldenshoe.com/Archive/cat_ortho.htm))?
- split pairs?
- what is the sole material - leather or rubber?
- are the shoes hand-stitched?
- what reprocessing is available?
- boots with removable footbed?

## Allen Edmonds

They split the pair: different sizes for different feet if needed!

For orthotics, I need removable footbeds - which they do not do any more it seems:
- Ashton, Benton - no longer made
- Dress Orthotics Collection - no longer made
- Wanderer - no longer made

Stores in Manhattan:
- NY: 551 Madison Avenue
- 61 West 49th
- 24 East 44th

"Damien" is their fisherman sandal:
- it is on the way out
- it has a buckle instead of velcro
- it is not width-adjustable
In short, Finn Comfort Baltrum is better...
