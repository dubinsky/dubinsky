## Cobbler
Greg at [Colonial Shoe Repair](https://colonialshoerepair.com/) is allegedly a good cobbler.

## Material

Shell Cordovan looks interesting, but there are downsides that probably make it
[not for me](https://shoegazing.com/2020/06/05/in-depth-the-downside-of-shell-cordovan/): it is too stiff and does not breathe...
Also, Ronnie from the Moulded Shoe told me that it is not great for orthotics: not enough depth...

I do not like the looks of full-grain.

Waxhide is not for dress shoes it seems.

This leaves calfskin :)

## Style
- plain toe
- straight cap
- medallion cap

and not:
- long wing tip
- Balmoral saddle
- Algonquin Split Toe
## Finn Comfort
- Baltrum sandals: 41
- Milano: 8 UK
- Budapest: 8 UK

## Upgrade
Let's try some better Oxford/Blucher/Gibbons lace-ups
that are compatible with orthotics, i.e. have removable footbeds.

Manufacturers:
- [Alden](http://www.aldenshoe.com) - USA
- [Allen Edmonds](https://www.allenedmonds.com/) - USA
- [Grant Stone](http://www.grantstoneshoes.com)
- Johnson & Murphy - quality deteriorated

## Alden

- [Moulded Shoe NY](https://www.mouldedshoeny.com): (carries modified last and CDI) 10 East 39th Street
- [Main NY](https://aldenmadison.com): 340 Madison Ave @ 44th
- [official online](https://www.theshoemart.com/alden-shoes)

I fully expected that I need modified last, so I went to the only place in the US where it is available - Moulded Shoe. Turns out, modified last is actually not for me; what I need is [Contour Depth Inlay (CDI)](http://www.aldenshoe.com/Archive/cat_ortho_cdi_facts.htm) - which is also only available at Moulded Shoe ;)

There are very few CDI models in black (as of 1/2026, each is $695):
 - [D3405](https://www.mouldedshoeny.com/alden-foot-balance/d3405-black-calfskin-cdi) Plain Toe - this is what I bough, in 7EEE
 - [D1531](https://www.mouldedshoeny.com/alden-foot-balance/d1531) Straight Cap Toe - this is what I should have bought, but it does not seem to exist in 7EEE ;)
 - [307](https://www.mouldedshoeny.com/alden-foot-balance/307-black-calfskin-cdi) lace-up boots

Moulded Shoe also does re-processing in-house, using Alden materials, so I do not need to send my shoes to Alden.

## Allen Edmonds

They split the pair: different sizes for different feet if needed!

For orthotics, I need removable footbeds - which they do not do any more it seems:
- Ashton, Benton - no longer made
- Dress Orthotics Collection - no longer made
- Wanderer - no longer made

Stores in Manhattan:
- NY: 551 Madison Avenue
- 61 West 49th
- 24 East 44th
