*Chipset*: **Z890**. I do not need all of its power, and do not really want to pay $300+ for the motherboard, but I also do not want to discover that something I want is missing from a budget motherboard (which are not yet available anyway).

*Form Factor*: Mini-**ITX** (170 mm × 170 mm) - let's try something small this time :)

*CPU: [**Intel Core Ultra 9 285K**](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/241060/intel-core-ultra-9-processor-285k-36m-cache-up-to-5-70-ghz/specifications.html)  $630 from BandH; sales tax refunded*

*Motherboard*:
	Mini-ITX (170 mm × 170 mm) (2xCUDIMM, 128)
	- [Asus ROG Strix Z890-I Gaming WiFI](https://rog.asus.com/motherboards/rog-strix/rog-strix-z890-i-gaming-wifi/)  [Amazon $450](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-STRIX-Z890-I-GAMING-WIFI/dp/B0DGWTXD4L)

			- RAM 9466MHz+; 2xTB4, front USB-C
		- MSI: none
		- Gigabyte: 1xUSB-4

*CPU Cooler*: [**NH-D15 G2**](https://noctua.at/en/nh-d15-g2) $150 at Amazon
	AIO probably makes more noise, and Noctua passive cooler with one fan is probably not enough...

Case: aluminum extrusions: [Yoqanr](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097RXPSY8) or [egowz](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CW5LFF5P/); see also [BeamCase](https://www.printables.com/model/740517-beamcase-sff-modular-itx-case) - and https://www.framingtech.com/ since:
- DeepCool CH160/CH170 with mesh side panel - company is under sanctions
- Jonsbo C6-ITX Black (PSU/cooler clash? does not really fit D15 cooler, although its specs list 168mm and the cases's 170
- LianLi O11 AIR MINI - does not fit the cooler

Got egowz for $53 at Amazon. Instructions: https://www.zwzdiy.cc/M/Product/24LHST/, more specifically: https://www.zwzdiy.cc/M/Product/3875925916.html.

*SSD*: **Samsung 990 Pro** 4TB $320 - preferably without the heatsink, so I can use the one on the motherboard (although model with heatsink is cheaper at $300). - got for $322 at Amazon

*RAM*: CUDIMMS 2x64 are not yet available; I can give up on CUDIMMS or buy something for the new build that I will stick into the previous desktop when CUDIMMS become available... 

RAM in the 2022 desktop with the MSI PRO Z690-A WiFi motherboard: max 128/192, 5600 JDEC 6400+ OC; currently, 4x16 Corsair CMK32GX5M2B5600C36 DDR5 5600 MT/s 1.1 V `$ sudo dmidecode -t memory`
2x48GB:
- CORSAIR Dominator Titanium  6800 (54400) MP96GX5M2B6800C40 (Z890 also) $360 Amazon
- CORSAIR Vengeance RGB 7200 (PC5 57600) CMH96GX5M2B7200C40 $380 (Z890 also) OOS NewEgg; $419 Amazon
- CORSAIR Vengeance 7000 (56000) CMK96GX5M2B7000C40 $350 OOS NewEgg; $385 Amazon - **got from Amazon!**

around $1,855 without PSU

PSU Wattage:136-**250**-275-370 for CPU; 30 for motherboard; 27-37 for RAM; 9 for SSD; so, around 450.

PSU sizes:
- ATX PS/3 150mm (W) x 86mm (H) x 140mm (D)
- SFX 125mm (W) x 63.5mm (H) x 100mm (D); deeper for SFX-L
- Flex ATX 81.5mm (W) x 40.5mm (H) x 150mm (D)
- TFX12V 85 64 175

Flex/TFX are too loud with their 40mm fans, even [Enhance ENP-8345L 450W Modular Platinum Flex ATX](https://www.amazon.com/Enhance-ENP-8345L-Modular-Platinum-Warranty/dp/B0D7W5FYX6) $140 at Amazon; 81.5mm (W) x 40.5mm (H) x 165mm (D).

So, SFX/SFX-L.
