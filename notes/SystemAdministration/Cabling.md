## Patch Panel
A few 24 port panels, not the 48 port ones.
With insertable keystones, not like the one I have.
Keystones - patch-down for cable runs; a few path-through for devices in the rack.
Crimper tool - or just punch them down?
Neat patch cover?
## Cables
A spool of Cat 6a?
Patch cables?
## Server Case
- 4U case?
