- get XML declaration as a processing instruction
- Plans - create issues describing them:
  - DTD parsing:
    - parseDTD()
    - https://docs.oracle.com/cd/A87860_01/doc/appdev.817/a86030/adx17p14.htm
    - https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxb-dtd-parser/blob/master/dtd-parser/src/main/java/com/sun/xml/dtdparser/DTDParser.java
  - Binary incompatible plans:
    - Remove include-related classes
    - Replace element content model
    - XMLLoader's T type parameter is always Elem and should be removed
    - XMLLoader.adapter should be removed
    - do not derive FactoryAdapter from XMLLoader
  - ConstructingParser:
    - https://github.com/apache/daffodil/blob/main/daffodil-lib/src/main/scala/org/apache/daffodil/lib/xml/DaffodilConstructingLoader.scala
    - CData and Xerces?
    - see if they can be weened off of it to normal XMLReader...
    - for my use?
    - for feature-parity with the SAX-based parser
    - is this what the includer is for? remove it?
